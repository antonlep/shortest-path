# Week 1
## Things done this week
* Some background research about different project topics
* Quick look through of jump point search algorithm, trying to get basic idea how it works
* Testing how to import .map file and export image file (outside of version control)
* Project creation
* Project definition document

## Problems
* No big issues, don't think I understood JPS algorithm completely but hopefully it will become more clear in future

## Plans for next week
* Create working program that calculates shortest path with Dijkstra with command line arguments 
* Set up unit testing, code coverage report and linting

## Time used
15 h
