# Week 2
## Things done this week
* Working program that calculates shortest path with Dijkstra with command line arguments
  * .map file import.
  * Shortest distance calculation with Dijksta algorithm. Calculates shortest distance, shortest route and visited nodes.
  * Result export as .png file.
* Unit tests, code coverage, docstrings and linting added.
* Continous integration with GitHub Actions, connected to codecov.

## Problems
* No big issues at the moment. Calculated distance is slightly different than reference value, could be related to the way how algorithm cut corners diagonally.

## Plans for next week
* Find out reason why calculated distance differs from reference value. Test with obstacles and diagonal movemement. 
* Research JPS algorithm and start to implement.

## Time used
15 h
