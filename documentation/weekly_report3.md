# Week 3
## Things done this week
* Distance caluclation works correctly now. X and y directions needed to be corrected and the algorithm had to be prevented to cut corners.
* A* algorithm was implemented to compare with Dijkstra and to ensure that visited nodes and route are calculated correctly.
* Testing with couple of different input files.
* Some code refactoring to remove redundant parts.
* Unit test coverage improvement.

## Problems
* No big issues at the moment. Calculated distance is slightly different than reference value, could be related to the way how algorithm cut corners diagonally.

## Plans for next week
* Research JPS algorithm and start to implement.

## Time used
15 h
