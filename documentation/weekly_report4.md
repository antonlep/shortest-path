# Week 4
## Things done this week
* Distance caluclation works correctly now. X and y directions needed to be corrected and the algorithm had to be prevented to cut corners.
* A* algorithm was implemented to compare with Dijkstra and to ensure that visited nodes and route are calculated correctly.
* Testing with a couple of different input files and points.
* Code refactoring to remove redundant parts.
* More unit tests.
* Start to write test document.
* JPS algorithm research.

## Problems
* No big issues at the moment. 

## Plans for next week
* Start to implement JPS algorithm.

## Time used
15 h
