# Week 4
## Things done this week
* JPS algorithm initial implementation. At the moment calculates correct distances and jump points. Calculation speed could be improved.
* Four test cases with relatively small maps have been defined to ensure that calculated routes, visited nodes and shortest distance is correct.
* Initial performance comparison with large map.
* Test document update.
* Start to write implementation document.


## Problems
* JPS algorithm is too slow at the moment, probably related to how neighbor nodes are currently checked as there are quite many checks to see if specific element is in a list.

## Plans for next week
* Improve JPS algorithm speed (first change how neighbor nodes are checked)
* Include checks for command line arguments (possibly separate class)
* Clean up index.py file

## Time used
15 h
