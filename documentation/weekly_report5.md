 Week 5
## Things done this week
* JPS algorithm corrected, there were issues with neighbor checking. These modifications improved calculation time significantly.
* More unit tests added for JPS and for other classes.
* Initial performance comparison with large map.
* Test document update.
* Start to write implementation document.


## Problems
* JPS algorithm is too slow at the moment, probably related to how neighbor nodes are currently checked as there are quite many checks to see if specific element is in a list.

## Plans for next week
* Improve JPS algorithm speed (first change how neighbor nodes are checked)
* More unit tests for JPS
* Include checks for command line arguments (possibly separate class)
* Clean up index.py file

## Time used
15 h
