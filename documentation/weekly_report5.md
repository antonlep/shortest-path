# Week 5
## Things done this week
* JPS algorithm corrected, there were issues with neighbor checking. These modifications improved calculation time significantly.
* More unit tests added for JPS and for other classes.
* Checks for command line arguments added.
* Code refactoring to clean up index.py file and divide the content into separate classes.
* Benchmark calculation functionality added.
* Benchamrk cases calculated with two maps and three algorithms.
* Test document and implementation document update.
* Peer review made.

## Problems
* No bigger issues at the moment.

## Plans for next week
* Improve JPS algorithm speed (first change how neighbor nodes are checked)
* More unit tests for JPS
* Include checks for command line arguments (possibly separate class)
* Clean up index.py file

## Time used
20 h
