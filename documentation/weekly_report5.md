# Week 5
## Things done this week
* JPS algorithm corrected, there were issues with neighbor checking. These modifications improved calculation time significantly.
* More unit tests added for JPS and for other classes.
* Checks for command line arguments added.
* Code refactoring to clean up index.py file and divide the content into separate classes.
* Benchmark calculation functionality added.
* Benchamrk cases calculated with two maps and three algorithms.
* Test document and implementation document update.
* Peer review made.

## Problems
* No bigger issues at the moment.

## Plans for next week
* Clean up JPS algorithm and look for possible improvements. At the moment code is quite complicated. 
* More comprehensive unit tests.
* Analyze more benchmark cases and compare calculation speeds more thoroughly.
* Create UML diagram of program structure.
* Possibly create a simple command line user interface.

## Time used
20 h
