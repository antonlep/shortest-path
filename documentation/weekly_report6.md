# Week 6
## Things done this week
* A few JPS code modifications were tried. Turned out that the way conditional statements and loops are arranged has big influence on performance and it is not possible to easily make code more compact without affecting calculation speed.
* Some similar lines in algorithms were removed.
* Picture display added.
* More unit tests added.
* UML diagram added.
* One additional benchmark case created and performance comparison made.
* Peer review made.

## Problems
* No bigger issues at the moment.

## Plans for next week
* Clean up algorithms more, there are some similar lines in files.
* O(n) analysis of code.
* Possibly create a simple command line user interface.
* Make more sensible tests for file reading and writing.
* If there is time left, make more performance comparisons.

## Time used
